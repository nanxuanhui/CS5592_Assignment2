#Problem2

#1. Find out the best data-structure to represent / store the graph in memory.
#2. Devise an algorithm to assign the labels to the vertices using vertex k-labeling definition. (Main Task)
"""
Start by assigning the label 1 to the central node.
For each branch extending from the central node, assign labels incrementally along the branch.
By incrementing labels along each branch, ensure that the weight of each edge (the sum of adjacent node labels)
is unique within each branch. To avoid duplicate edge weights across different branches, an incremental offset
can be added to the starting label of each branch based on the branch index. This approach ensures that edge
weights are unique across the entire graph. Calculate the edge weights and store them in a set to verify that
all edge weights are unique.
"""
#3. What design strategy you will apply, also give justifications that selected strategy is most appropriate.
"""
Greedy Labeling with Incremental Constraints
The greedy method is highly efficient for node labeling as it minimizes the need for complex calculations or 
backtracking. Each label assignment is based on a simple incremental rule, resulting in low computational 
requirements. Ensuring the uniqueness of edge weights is the key constraint in this problem. The greedy 
method with incremental constraints systematically prevents duplicate weights by controlling the increment 
pattern within and between branches. This strategy is simple to implement, involving only label assignment 
and weight calculation operations. For large graphs with more branches or longer branches, this method scales 
well, as it can be applied consistently regardless of the number of vertices or branches.
"""
#4. How traversing will be applied?
#5. Store the labels of vertices and weights of the edges as an outcome.
#6. Compare your results with mathematical property and tabulate the outcomes for comparison.
#7. Hardware resources supported until what maximum value of V,E.
#8. Compute the Time Complexity of your algorithm T(V,E) or T(n).
