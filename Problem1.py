#1. Find out the best data-structure to represent / store the graph in memory.
"""
Lob(n, p) graph structure, where each star graph S_p has its center connected
to each vertex in the path graph P_n.
"""
#2.Devise an algorithm to assign the labels to the vertices using vertex k-labeling definition.(Main Task)
"""
Given a "Homogeneous Lobster+1" graph where each vertex in the path P_n connects to two star graphs S_p.
Start with an empty dictionary to store the labels for each vertex.
Assign consecutive labels to the vertices in the path P_n.
For example, assign label 1 to the first path node P_n0, and increment the label by 1 for each subsequent node.
This ensures each vertex in the path graph has a unique label.
For each node in the path P_n, two star graph centers are connected to it
Assign distinct labels to these star centers. You can alternate labels to avoid conflicts with path nodes.
For each star graph center, assign unique labels to its leaves relative to the center.
For example, if the center of S1 is labeled 2, its leaves can be labeled 4, 5, etc., to its leaves.
Repeat this for each star graph, ensuring that the leaves of the same star graph have unique labels distinct from the
center and adjacent nodes.
After the initial assignment, verify that all connected nodes have distinct labels.
If any conflicts arise (e.g., two adjacent nodes with the same label), increment the label for one of the nodes to
resolve the conflict.
"""
#3. What design strategy you will apply, also give justifications that selected strategy is most appropriate.
"""
Greedy Algorithm
Vertex labeling is inherently a sequential decision problem: we label one vertex at a time, aiming to minimize
conflicts with adjacent vertices. The Greedy approach is ideal here, as it allows us to label each vertex in a
single pass, without needing to backtrack or re-evaluate previous assignments.
The main goal of k-labeling is to ensure that no two connected vertices share the same label. By assigning labels 
incrementally and checking adjacent nodes for conflicts, the Greedy strategy can immediately rule out conflicting 
labels and proceed with the next optimal choice.
Greedy algorithms are generally efficient, with low time complexity. For this problem, we only need to visit each 
vertex once and check adjacent vertices, making the Greedy strategy computationally efficient. This low complexity 
is especially important if the graph has a large number of vertices.
Vertex k-labeling is a form of graph coloring, where we aim to assign labels (colors) to nodes such that adjacent 
nodes donâ€™t share the same label. Greedy algorithms are widely used in graph coloring problems because they offer 
quick, approximate solutions by making locally optimal choices. This approach aligns well with the requirements of 
the k-labeling problem.
"""
#4. How traversing will be applied?
"""
Depth-First Search (DFS):
Start at a Path Node (Pn): Since the path graph Pn forms the backbone of the Lobster structure, we can start the 
traversal from any path node (e.g.,Pn0).
Traverse Through the Path Nodes: Move sequentially along the path nodes in Pn, one by one.
Visit Star Centers and Leaves: When reaching a path node, visit its connected star centers, and then recursively 
visit each leaf connected to the centers.
Backtrack to Continue Traversal: Once all nodes connected to a given path node are visited, backtrack to the next 
unvisited node along the path and repeat until all nodes in the graph are visited.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Initialize the Queue with a Path Node: Choose a starting path node, such as Pn0, and add it to the queue.
Dequeue a path node and visit its neighbors: first the connected star centers and then the leaves attached to those centers.
Add each unvisited neighbor to the queue to ensure they are explored in the next levels of traversal.
Continue Traversing the Path Nodes: Once all connections of the current path node are explored, move to the next path node 
in the queue and repeat the process.
Process Until the Queue is Empty: Continue until all nodes are visited and the queue is empty.
